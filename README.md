# ai-config

Declarative plugin manager for Claude Code — with cross-tool conversion to Codex, Cursor, OpenCode, and Pi.

## Why this exists

You've spent time building up your AI coding setup: custom skills, MCP servers, hooks, workflows. Then you want to try Codex or Pi, and you're starting from scratch. Or you get a new machine and have to remember what you installed.

ai-config solves both problems. You define your setup in one YAML file, then use it to:

1. **Install your Claude Code plugins reproducibly** across machines with `ai-config sync`.
2. **Convert those plugins** for other tools — same skills, same config, less manual porting.

No more vendor lock-in because your customizations are trapped in one tool's config directory. No more juggling dotfiles across `.claude/`, `.codex/`, `.cursor/`, `.opencode/`, and `.pi/`.

Or more simply: run `ai-config init` and it walks you through the config.

## What this isn't

This README does not have:

- 14 shields.io badges declaring build status, coverage, npm downloads, discord members, twitter followers, and mass-to-charge ratio
- A mass of emojis to make it look "friendly" and "approachable"
- Claims about revolutionizing your development workflow
- A "Quick Start" that's actually 73 steps
- Screenshots of a dashboard that doesn't exist
- A "Powered by AI" badge despite just being a for-loop

It's a config file and some commands. That's it.

## Install

```bash
pip install ai-config-cli
# or
uv tool install ai-config-cli
```

This installs the `ai-config` command. Check that it resolves before changing any tool config:

```bash
ai-config --help
```

From source, use the repo URL instead:

```bash
uv tool install git+https://github.com/safurrier/ai-config
```

## Quick start: preview before you sync

**1. Create a config**

```bash
ai-config init
```

The wizard adds marketplaces and plugins, then writes `.ai-config/config.yaml` unless you pass `-o`. If the wizard offers to run sync immediately, say no when you want to inspect the file first.

**2. Preview the changes**

```bash
ai-config sync --dry-run
```

This is the safe checkpoint. It shows what would be installed, removed, or converted without writing plugin output.

**3. Apply the sync**

```bash
ai-config sync --verify
```

This makes installed plugins match your config and verifies the result. If your config enables conversion, sync also writes target-tool output for Codex, Cursor, OpenCode, and Pi according to your conversion scope.

**4. Check for problems**

```bash
ai-config doctor
```

Claude Code loads plugins at session start. After sync changes plugins, restart Claude Code to apply them. Use `claude --resume` if you want to continue the previous session.

## What sync does

A config can install Claude Code plugins and convert them for other tools:

```yaml
version: 1
targets:
  - type: claude
    config:
      marketplaces:
        my-plugins:
          source: github
          repo: myorg/ai-plugins
      plugins:
        - id: code-review@my-plugins
          scope: user
      conversion:
        enabled: true
        targets: [codex, cursor, opencode, pi]
        scope: user
```

With conversion enabled, `ai-config sync` can write outputs such as:

- **Claude Code**: plugins installed through Claude Code's plugin system
- **Codex**: skills, MCP config, prompts, and supported hooks under `.codex/` or `~/.codex/`
- **Cursor**: skills, commands, hooks, and MCP config under `.cursor/` or `~/.cursor/`
- **OpenCode**: skills plus `opencode.json` / `opencode.lsp.json`
- **Pi**: skills, prompt templates, and hook extensions under `.pi/` or `~/.pi/`

The exact paths depend on conversion `scope` and `output_dir`. See [Configuration](docs/config.md) and [Conversion](docs/conversion.md) for the full rules instead of treating this README as the reference manual.

## Config lookup

By default, commands look for config in this order:

1. `.ai-config/config.yaml`
2. `.ai-config/config.yml`
3. `~/.ai-config/config.yaml`
4. `~/.ai-config/config.yml`

Project-local config wins over global config. Pass `-c /path/to/config.yaml` to use a specific file.

Relative local marketplace paths and conversion output paths are resolved from the config's project root. Environment variables and `~` are expanded at load time, so paths like `$DOTS_REPO/plugins` can stay portable in dotfiles.

## Common workflows

| Workflow | Command | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Create or update config interactively | `ai-config init` | Writes `.ai-config/config.yaml` by default. |
| Preview sync | `ai-config sync --dry-run` | Use before the first real sync or after large config edits. |
| Apply and verify sync | `ai-config sync --verify` | Installs/uninstalls plugins and runs configured conversion. |
| See installed state | `ai-config status` | Add `--verify` to compare against config. |
| Validate config or output | `ai-config doctor` | Use `--target codex`, `--target cursor`, `--target opencode`, or `--target pi` for converted output. |
| Rebuild stale output | `ai-config sync --fresh` | Clears cache and re-converts everything. |
| Re-run conversion only | `ai-config sync --force-convert` | Useful after changing conversion targets. |
| Develop local plugins | `ai-config watch` | Add `--dry-run` if you only want file-change reports. |

For options and examples, use [Commands](docs/commands.md). For target behavior and fidelity notes, use [Conversion](docs/conversion.md).

## Development

```bash
git clone https://github.com/safurrier/ai-config.git
cd ai-config
uv sync --all-extras
uv run ruff check src/
uv run ty check src/
uv run pytest tests/unit/ -v
```

If you use `just`, the shortcut is:

```bash
just setup
just check
```

## Troubleshooting

**DO preview first, NOT blind sync, BECAUSE sync can install/uninstall plugins and write converted tool config.**

```bash
ai-config sync --dry-run
```

**DO use `--fresh` when cached plugins or converted output look stale, NOT hand-delete random target files first, BECAUSE sync knows the cache and conversion state.**

```bash
ai-config sync --fresh
```

**DO validate converted output with target doctor, NOT assume every Claude feature maps 1:1, BECAUSE some hooks, MCP settings, commands, and agents degrade or skip depending on the target.**

```bash
ai-config doctor --target all ./output-dir
```
