# Architecture decisions

These records explain lasting choices whose rationale is established in repository history. They complement the current contract in [SPEC.md](https://github.com/safurrier/ai-config/blob/main/SPEC.md), the [architecture overview](../architecture.md), and the [project evolution](../project-evolution.md).
